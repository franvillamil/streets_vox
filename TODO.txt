IDEA:

- Many recent debates about What are the long-term consequences of violence for local polarization? And what are the key mechanisms? We focus here on the backlash over the politics of memory.

- Focus on the case of Spain: recent rise of a far-right party VOX, etc, a lot of discussion about conflict memories, important cleavage, probable link to polarization dynamics.

- We first show that there is a correlation between Francoist wartime violence and VOX vote. That is, in places more exposed to wartime violence, people were *more* likely to vote to the far-right party VOX. How to explain this? It might have to do with a backlash over the memories of the conflict: a more salient cleavage on the politics of memory might be related to an authoritarian backlash.

- Cross-sectional analysis again show there is a correlation between VOX vote in both 2019 elections and both the number of exhumed mass graves and the removal of Francoist streets sicne 2001.

- A problem is this are just correlations. We explore this mechanism further by exploring the impact of the Francoist street name removal on the growth of VOX electoral support between 2016 elections, when they got less than 1% of the total vote, and April 2019 elections, when they got more than 10%. We do so using a diff-in-diff setup only considering municipalities that had some Francoist street in 2016, which should provide a much better identification strategy.

- Results support evidence for the backlash story on the politics of memory and suggest that local authoritarian backlash could explain dynamics of polarization related to conflict dynamics.
