  -[X] Crear stargazer tables of logit models
-[X] In sample (w/st 2016): differences between control and treatment condition, compare (and discuss results from table 1 in Appendix)
-[X] Treatment strength (mean number of streets removed, absolute / relative, ...) (>> mean_trt_treated.tex)
-[X] Parallel trends up to 2016 (mean share in T/C for PP, PSOE, VOX) [R1 dice de poner tablas A5/A6 en el main text, pero no hay puto sitio]

# MODEL CHANGES

-[X] Incluir PSOE para las parallel trends (tablas A5/A6)
