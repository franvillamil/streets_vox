macro:->Vox
is
a
relatively
new
party
which
promotes
a
discourse
based
on
authoritarian
conservatism
and
a
hard-line
version
of
Spanish
nationalism.
It
originated
in
2013
from
a
split
in
the
traditional
right-wing
party
(Partido
Popular,
or
PP).
It
shares
with
other
populist
right-wing
parties
in
Europe
a
nativist
ideology
and
a
rejection
of
immigration,
gender
policies,
and
the
social
welfare
state
\citep
{Turnbull-Dugarte:2019aa,

the
Law
of
Historical
Memory
as
an
instrument
of
leftist
propaganda,
Vox
campaigned
on
the
national
unity
of
Spain
as
a
way
of
leaving
behind
historical
divisions
and
enacted
the
figure
of
Francisco
Franco
as
an
important
political
leader
who
brought
peace
and
stability
to
the
country.
