Vox
promotes
a
discourse

authoritarian
conservatism

a
hard-line
version
of
Spanish
nationalism.
It
shares
with
other
populist

parties
in

a
nativist
ideology

a
rejection
of
immigration,

policies,
and

macro:->Municipalities
that
still

portrayed
as
the
`resistance'
to
the
LHM
\citep
{Blanco-Elipe:2018aa}.
Their
dodging
of
the
LHM
was
possible
because
of
delays
in
the
legal
procedures
or
some
form
of
`foot-dragging'
by
local
authorities.
